See the following screenshots :

The application (v 0.1) and the sample can be downloaded at http://dwayneb.free.fr/download/

The application currently support only jdk15 and testng-jdk15.
To run the application (under DOS or Unix):
  download [testng_gui-0.1.tar.gz|http://dwayneb.free.fr/download/testng-gui-0.1.tar.gz] and unarchive it (include testng)
```
  $> java -jar testng-gui-0.1/testng-gui.jar
```
I’ll try to convert the standalone application into a Netbeans module usable with java project.

I’ve got a TODO list, but any feedback’s are welcome.
